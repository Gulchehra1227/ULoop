Project Summary – Uloop

Uloop is a scalable digital academic ecosystem designed to improve student performance, focus, and engagement. It combines structured learning, accountability tools, and peer support into one integrated platform.

The system addresses key student challenges such as procrastination, unstructured exam preparation, limited professor feedback transparency, and disconnected academic communities.

Core features include:

Anonymous Professor Feedback System – Students rate and review instructors, with aggregated evaluations while maintaining anonymity.

Study Stream (Live Focus Mode) – Camera-based group study sessions that end automatically if users switch tabs, ensuring accountability and concentration.

Integrated Planner – Students track completed tasks and set daily goals to build discipline and productivity.

MainMap – A syllabus-aligned mastery system requiring 80% test completion before progressing.

Exam Simulations – Randomized practice exams for structured preparation.

Major-Based & A+ Networks – Field-specific groups and high-GPA student mentoring communities.

Uloop can be implemented within a single university, licensed institutionally, or expanded into a multi-university EdTech platform.
